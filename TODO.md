# TODO

- Use (and configure) different services (agolia, email subscription)
- Appealing screenshot of what we will do/build
- Graphql playground:
  - query in src/data/LandingPlayground.ts
  - endpoint/fake data
- Update content
  - (nth) make basic and advanced section generic


## Content

- lessons have sections and chapters. They are also tagged by backend, frontend and "introduction" (rename it
  fundamentals?)
- There sections and tag are hard-coded but chapters are auto-pulled
  from frontmatter in `content/{tag}/{section}/{chapter name}`
- Content of the "path" section is in src/data/stacks.ts
